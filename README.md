This project is about a web application that tracks a user's monthly carbon footprint based upon how much they spend on their energy bills and their geographical location. 
The project works by having the user fill out information manually about their spending amount on bills, their lifestyle, and their location. The input is then passed into multiple formulas that calculate the carbon footprint of the individual.
The project's intention is to make users aware about the exact value of their carbon footprint and incentivize users to keep their emissions low, as in return they may receive benefits and rewards.
It was intended and built only as a minimum viable product for the hackathon. Therefore, it is missing functionality such as data storage of a user's emissions over time and user authentication for security.
It is also missing an automatic search and input of the user's bank information. As a result, all information must be manually inputted by the user each month.
The formula for calculating carbon footprint must also be further reviewed for accuracy across all inputs.
